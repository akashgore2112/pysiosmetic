# Physiosmetic Hero Experience

This repository hosts the premium **PHYSIOSMETIC** hero experience showcased in `physio-hero-advanced.html`.

## Updated build
- Latest interactive hero interface, cards, and assessment tools live in [`physio-hero-advanced.html`](physio-hero-advanced.html).
- Refined WebGL particle ambience starts automatically with calmer motion, softer lighting, and responsive density. A CSS-driven fallback keeps motion subtle on devices without WebGL.
- Full-viewport `#hero-bg` canvas includes a reduced-motion preference check to disable animation while leaving the UI accessible.

## Preview locally
1. Open `physio-hero-advanced.html` directly in your browser, or
2. Serve the file via any static web server (for example, `python -m http.server`) and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/physio-hero-advanced.html`.

The design is fully responsive and includes the latest enhancements requested in the previous revisions.
